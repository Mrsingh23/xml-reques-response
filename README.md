# xml-request-response
* This repo is to demo on how to produce xml as response instead of JSON
* By default, Spring boot response is in JSON

   * `<dependency>
            <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
            <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
            <version>2.13.4</version>
